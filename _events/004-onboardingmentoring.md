As we head into the summer months, student internship programs are underway, albeit virtually as many of us are now working remotely in response to COVID-19 social distancing practices. Several laboratories have already onboarded interns and new team members to work remotely with geographically dispersed teams. What are some lessons learned and best practices about onboarding new hires that we can take away from this experience? In the fourth installment of this IDEAS-ECP panel discussion series, we bring together several staff members of DOE laboratories, who will speak about their experiences in onboarding and mentoring new hires virtually. Topics include challenges, lessons learned, unforeseen benefits, and opportunities to look for from this experience.
