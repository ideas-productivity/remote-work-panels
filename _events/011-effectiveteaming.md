**This panel discussion is part of the DOE Laboratories of the Future (LOTF) workshop series. Registration is required.**

DOE laboratories are globally recognized to be masters of science at scale, interdisciplinary research, and operating national user facilities. At the same time, the laboratory complex is entering its eighth decade of existence and retains vestiges of its World War II roots. As the stewards of this national treasure, it is our job to ensure the laboratories have the resources and structures to thrive for the next 70 years and beyond.

**Purpose of Workshop:** The next event in the DOE Laboratories of the Future (LOTF) workshop series will be focused on effective teaming across the DOE laboratories and how we can best integrate new tools and mechanisms for virtual collaboration. Panel speakers will address:

* How do decision-making teams work together effectively?
* How can virtual collaborative tools help stimulate innovative collaborations?
* What are strategies for working remotely at the national labs?
* What new models of collaborative teaming can be adopted?
