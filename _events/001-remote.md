Working remotely has suddenly become a near-universal experience for
staff members of research organizations, but for some it has been a
way of life for years.  In this panel discussion, we brought together
five staff members of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories,
all members of the DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP), with years of
varied experience working remotely.  Topics included advice to people
just getting started with working remotely, challenges, unforeseen
benefits, and opportunities to look for from this experience, with
emphasis on issues faced by collaborating teams in computational
research.  Panelists made brief introductory comments followed by open
discussion.
