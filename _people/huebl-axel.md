Axel Huebl is a postdoctoral scholar at Berkeley Lab where he is part
of the ECP-WarpX team. Prior to joining a DOE lab, he contributed to
open source HPC software for about seven years, establishing
development efforts in teams that are fluctuating in availability
(e.g. students) or live in multiple time zones. One of his key
experiences from this is that communication, transparency of decision
processes, documentation and accountability are key for productivity
(and happiness) in decentral teams.
