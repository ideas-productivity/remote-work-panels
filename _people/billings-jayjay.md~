Mike Bernhardt started the Bernhardt Agency in 1994, focused on
helping companies in the HPC market segment. After less than a year of
running the agency from an office in downtown Portland, and dealing
with the frustration of parking, commuter traffic, and the rising cost
of office space, he decided to take the company virtual.  He ran this
agency, and two subsequent agencies as virtual organizations for 19
years, eventually employing more than 25 full-time employees working
from their homes offering communications services to companies
throughout the HPC ecosystem in North America.  In 2001, 2002, and
2003, his [virtual] agency was named the top marketing agency to work
for by Oregon Business magazine, and in 2003 it took top honors as the
#1 small business to work for in Oregon.  Mike currently leads
communications and outreach for ECP.
