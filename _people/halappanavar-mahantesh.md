Mahantesh Halappanavar leads the ExaGraph project in ECP. He is the
acting Group Leader for the Data Sciences Group and the Team Lead for
the Scalable Data Analytics Team in the Physical and Computational
Sciences Directorate at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.  In
the transition to working remotely, his teams have faced challenges in
management, immigration, staff engagement, and secure communication
tools. An important lesson we all can learn from this experience is
that the manner in which an organization treats its staff and the
local community will determine its success in the long term.
