Ryan Shaw began working at Sandia National Laboratories in 2012 and has provided technical support to the Sierra suite of multiphysics simulation codes. Ryan volunteered to be a scrum master in 2014 when the previous one left the group, but he didnâ€™t really recognize the value of a scrum master until 2017 after working with two other teams and realizing that solving people problems was just as enjoyable for him as solving engineering problems. Ryan currently serves as scrum master for two teams and works to influence Sandia with his expertise and enthusiasm in helping others more effectively deliver product.
