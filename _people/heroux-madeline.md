Madeline Heroux is an educator with experience tutoring junior high,
high school and college students in the US and Japan.  She is
presently at Step-by-Step Montessori school in Minneapolis, MN,
working with young children. Her most recent efforts are focused on
the transition from in-person to remote learning.  In what can seem

structure that works best for them.
