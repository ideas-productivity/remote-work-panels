Katie Antypas is the Division Deputy and Data Department Head at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Katie was the Project Director of the NERSC-8 Cori supercomputer deployed in 2016 and served as the Project Director for the NERSC-9 Perlmutter system from 2017-2019. She is also the director of Hardware and Integration for the ECP project and a co-investigator on the ASCR research project titled, “Science Search: Automated MetaData Using Machine Learning” and is interested in how experimental science facilities can leverage High Performance Computing.  Her interests include application readiness for advanced architecture systems, I/O performance,  data movement and management and supporting experimental science on HPC systems. Before coming to NERSC, Katie worked at the ASC Flash Center at the University of Chicago on the FLASH code, a highly scalable, parallel, adaptive mesh refinement astrophysics application. She has an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Chicago and a bachelors in Physics from Wellesley College.
