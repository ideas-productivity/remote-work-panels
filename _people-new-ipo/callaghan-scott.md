He first got involved at SCEC as an undergraduate intern, then as a graduate student, and now as staff. Scott is the project lead on a software application which performs physics-based probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for California. This software typically runs on large HPC systems such as Blue Waters at NCSA and Titan at OLCF. His research interests include scientific workflows and high throughput computing.
