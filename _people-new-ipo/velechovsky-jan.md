Jan Velechovsky visited Los Alamos National Laboratory as a summer student in 2011. He returned as a research scientist in numerical methods for hydrodynamics in 2015. In the meantime, he finished his Ph.D. under dual supervision of the University of Bordeaux and of the Czech Technical University in Prague, which often required working remotely. Jan was exposed to agile framework for software development when he joined the Portage team in 2017. Since March, Jan has been working from home with an intermittent help from his two-year-old daughter.
