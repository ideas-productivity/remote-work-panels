-- Bio for panelist 7 --
Tom Evans specializes in the development, implementation, and application of computational radiation transport as applied in the areas of Nuclear Engineering, radiation detection, astrophysics, high energy density physics, and medical applications. His interests include stochastic and deterministic transport methods on massively parallel platforms, nonlinear and time-dependent transport methods, coupled physics including radiation-hydrodynamics and core-reactor physics, acceleration and preconditioning techniques, optimization and performance analysis, and large-scale scientific software design for parallel codes. He leads work at ORNL on energy applications in ECP.  He is working remotely during a pandemic in a house with a high school senior, college senior, and fellow scientist/manager/wife Kate.
