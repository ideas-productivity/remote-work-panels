David E. Bernholdt is a Distinguished R&D Staff Member in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. His research interests are, broadly, in software environments for high-performance scientific computing.  Over his 20-years at ORNL he has led and participated in many different projects focused variously on computer science or computational science research, nearly all “hybrid” in the sense of being multi-institutional and geographically distributed.  He also has experience (pre-COVID) managing a “hybrid” group.
